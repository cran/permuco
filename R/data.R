#' Datatset of the design for the data attentionshifting_signal
#'
#' @description Design of an experiment measuring the EEG brain activity of 15 participants who have been shown images of neutral and angry faces. Those faces were shown at a different visibility 16ms and 166ms and were displayed either to the left or to the right of a screen. The laterality, sex, age, and 2 measures of anxiety for each subjects are also available. The amplitude of the EEG recording are located in the dataset \link{attentionshifting_signal}.

#' \itemize{
#' \item id : identifier of the subject.
#' \item visibility : time of exposure to the image (16ms: subliminal or 166ms:supraliminal).
#' \item emotion : type of emotion of the image (angry or neutral).
#' \item direction : position of image one the screen (left or right).
#' \item laterality_id : measure of laterality of the subject.
#' \item age : age of the subject.
