# `permuco`

This package provides functions to compute permutation tests in linear models with nuisances variables. The package is focused on several goals :

* Providing to users the most recent methods to handle nuisance variables for permutation tests in the linear models.
* Giving to users tools to compute most common tests in linear model (t test, ANOVA and repeated measure ANOVA).
* Providing an extension for the multiple comparisons problems in linear models with a focus for EEG data.

## The `lmperm()` function
This function is constructed as an extension of the the `lm()` function for permutation test. It produce t statistics with univariate and bivariate pvalue by permutation.

## The `aovperm()` function
This function is constructed as an extension of the the `aov()` function for permutation test. It produces marginal F statistics (type III). Repeated measures anova are feasible using the same notations used in an `aov()` formula with `+Error(id/within)` to specify the random effects.

## The `clusterlm()` function
This function compute cluster-mass statistics for multiple comparisons. It is designed for ERP analysis of unichannel EEG data. The left part of formula object must be a matrix or dataframe which columns represents multiple responses tested on the same experimental design (specified by right part of the formula). This function provides several methods to handle nuisance variables, a F or t statistics, an extension for repeated measure anova and several methods for the multiple comparisons lit the threshold-free cluster enhancement.
